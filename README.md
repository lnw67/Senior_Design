# Senior_Design
 The following is code from the 2015-2016 Senior design project. The goal for this code was to allow for a fully automatic robot to move 
 Through a designed course hitting individual points defined by the group. When certain points were reached the robot would attempt to find 
 and capture victim pegs and return them to certain holding points. 
 The coding is based on the Arduino C/C+ based set functions. The code is designed to be modular to allow for easier modification 
 and management spread between all group members.  The hardware used for this project was the Arduino DUE microntroller. This was done 
 primarily due to its physical memory space, pin mapping, and ADC pins.
